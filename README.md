# üöö Skip Size Selector ‚Äì Modern UI Redesign

## **Overview**

This is a **complete redesign** of the ‚ÄúChoose Your Skip Size‚Äù page for We Want Waste, created as a technical challenge to showcase modern React skills, clean code, and thoughtful UI/UX design.

---

## **Stack & Tools**

- **React** (with functional components and hooks)
- **Vite** (blazing fast build tool to accelerate development)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling for rapid, responsive design)
- **react-icons** (for beautiful, consistent iconography)

---

## **Why This Approach?**

The original page felt visually outdated and a bit cluttered, which could make users less confident in their selection.
**I wanted something that felt trustworthy, modern, and easy to use on any device.**

### **My Focus Areas:**

- **Modern, clean look** ‚Äì Dark theme, bold colors, soft card UI, and clear icons for a professional feel.
- **Mobile-first, fully responsive** ‚Äì Designed to look great on both phones and desktops.
- **Better information display** ‚Äì Key details like size, capacity, dimensions, and restrictions (e.g. ‚ÄúNot allowed on road‚Äù) are clear at a glance.
- **Accessible and semantic** ‚Äì Good contrast, alt text, and ARIA labels for all critical actions.
- **Component-driven** ‚Äì Everything is broken into reusable React components for easy future edits or expansion.
- **Delightful user experience** ‚Äì Buttons, selection highlights, and stepper all give instant visual feedback.
- **Fast delivery** ‚Äì Used React + Vite to build, run, and iterate much more quickly, and Tailwind CSS to keep styling maintainable and lightning-fast to update.

## **Project Structure**

- **App.js** ‚Äì Main entry point; renders the full skip size selection page.
- **pages/ChooseSkipSize.js** ‚Äì Container for all main elements (Stepper, Hero, SkipGrid, Footer).
- **components/**

  - **SkipGrid.js** ‚Äì Lays out all skip size cards.
  - **SkipCard.js** ‚Äì Shows skip info, image, selection, and warning badges.
  - **Stepper.js** ‚Äì The step navigation bar at the top.
  - **Footer.js** ‚Äì Sticky footer for navigation/actions, adapting for mobile and desktop.
  - **Hero.js** ‚Äì Clean headline and description for clarity.

- **Data** is fetched from the provided API and used to populate skip options.

---

## **UI/UX Decisions**

- **Card Layout:**
  Cards are visually separated, with clear skip size, price, and a big ‚ÄúSelect‚Äù button. Each card has all the info a user needs.
- **Selection Feedback:**
  Selected card gets a colored border and shadow, and the button switches to ‚ÄúSelected‚Äù with a checkmark.
- **Stepper:**
  Custom stepper makes it obvious which part of the process the user is in.
- **Mobile Experience:**
  All components stack and reflow for mobile; the sticky footer is optimized for small screens.
- **Accessibility:**
  High-contrast colors, clear focus states, keyboard navigation, and alt texts.
- **Details Matter:**
  Badges for skip restrictions, icons for important info, and a clean price display with ‚Äúinc. delivery‚Äù.

---

## **How to Use**

- **Clone & install:**
  `npm install`

- **Run locally:**
  `npm run dev`
  (Uses Vite + React + TailwindCSS)

- **Choose a skip:**
  Click any ‚ÄúSelect This Skip‚Äù button. Only one skip can be selected at a time.

- **Continue/Back:**
  Use the sticky footer to go back or move forward (navigation handlers can be updated as needed).

---

## **API Data**

All skip options are loaded from:
`https://app.wewantwaste.co.uk/api/skips/by-location?postcode=NR32&area=Lowestoft`

- `components/SkipCard.js` ‚Äì Card component for skip info
- `components/Footer.js` ‚Äì Sticky footer with navigation
- `components/Stepper.js` ‚Äì Process steps at the top

## **Why this is better than the original**

- **Modern look inspires more trust** (potentially higher conversions)
- **Much better experience on mobile**
- **Information is easy to compare at a glance**
- **Accessible for all users**
- **Code is maintainable and ready for future features**

- Support for dynamic image URLs from API
- Routing for actual multi-step navigation
- Add test coverage for all components
